# Mapping the Cosmos: Building a Microservice-Driven Celestial Map Generator

## Introduction

Ever looked up at the night sky and wondered what the stars looked like on a specific date and time from a particular location? That's the question that sparked the creation of "Tu Cielo de Noche," a web application that transforms celestial data into personalized, printable star maps. This project wasn't just about pretty pictures; it was a deep dive into microservices, serverless architecture, and the intricacies of astronomical calculations. Join me as I share the journey of building this unique e-commerce experience.

## The Vision: Personalized Celestial Maps

"Tu Cielo de Noche" empowers users to generate a stunning stereographic representation of the night sky, capturing the precise positions of stars, planets, constellations, the moon's phase, and the sun, all based on a user-defined date, time, and location. The core of this application lies in its ability to translate complex astronomical data from the Hipparcos catalog (stored as a JSON file) into a visual masterpiece using the powerful `astronomy.js` library for the calculations.

## Tech Stack: A Microservices Approach

To bring this vision to life, I assembled a robust tech stack:

- **Next.js:** For a dynamic and performant frontend and API endpoints.
- **TypeScript:** Ensuring type safety and code maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid and responsive UI development.
- **Supabase:** Providing a reliable database and image storage solution.
- **Canvas.js:** For high-quality image rendering.
- **Stripe:** Handling secure payment processing.
- **Resend:** Sending automated order confirmation emails.
- **Prodigi API:** Integrating print-on-demand services for physical posters.
- **AWS SQS/Lambda:** Orchestrating background processing and job execution.
- **Docker:** For containerizing and deploying the Lambda function.

## The Challenge: Consistent Image Rendering

One of the biggest hurdles was ensuring consistent image quality and dimensions across all orders. Client-side rendering, while convenient, was limited by the user's screen resolution and DPI. To overcome this, I implemented a dual-rendering approach:

- **Client-Side:** For real-time previews and user interaction.
- **Server-Side:** For generating high-resolution, print-ready images.

This meant duplicating the celestial map processing logic, but it was essential for maintaining quality.

## The Workflow: Payment-Triggered Processing

To optimize resource usage and ensure that map generation only occurred for successful orders, I integrated Stripe webhooks. When a payment was successful, Stripe triggered a webhook event, which in turn placed a message containing the order ID and celestial map configuration onto an AWS SQS queue.

An AWS Lambda function, acting as a worker, then consumed these messages and executed the server-side celestial map processor. This ensured that map generation was tightly coupled with payment success.

## The Lambda Deployment Saga: Docker and Manifest Compatibility

Deploying the server-side celestial map processor as an AWS Lambda function presented a unique challenge. The `canvas.js` library, with its native dependencies, required a Docker image container for deployment.

However, I encountered a frustrating error: "manifest not compatible." After some research, I discovered that AWS Lambda had limitations with multi-architecture Docker image manifests. The solution was simple but crucial:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t celestial-map-processor:latest
```

By explicitly specifying the `linux/amd64` platform during the Docker build process, I resolved the manifest compatibility issue. This was a significant win, and it felt incredibly rewarding to overcome this technical hurdle.

## The Outcome: A Seamless Celestial Experience

With the deployment issues resolved, "Tu Cielo de Noche" began functioning flawlessly. Users could now effortlessly create personalized star maps, and the entire process, from payment to print-on-demand fulfillment, was automated.

## Key Takeaways:

- Microservices architecture offers flexibility and scalability.
- Serverless computing with AWS Lambda and SQS enables efficient background processing.
- Docker containerization simplifies complex deployments.
- Attention to platform-specific details is crucial for successful deployments.
- Webhooks are a very powerful tool to interconnect services.

Building "Tu Cielo de Noche" was a challenging yet incredibly rewarding experience. It's a testament to the power of modern web technologies and the ability to turn complex scientific data into a personalized and meaningful experience.
